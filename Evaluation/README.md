# Module 20 Individual Self Assessment Deliverable

## Self-assessment
My primary role in the project was on the database management which meant to take care of the ETL process from end to end.
Setting up the AWS RDS was tricky during the modules in the course but it ended up being very useful and we applied it in this project.

## Team assessment 
Very early in the project we talked and identified our technical and professional strengths. 
By doing so we distributed the tasks accordingly while making sure to support in other areas when it was needed.

## Very brief summary of the project
This project tries to answer the question of whether there's a quantitative relationship between the usage of renewable energies and CO2 emissions worldwide.
We analized the data by each country and generated a prediction model using machine learning techniques.
With the model generated we focused on a smaller group of countries to analyze the results and answer the initial questions.
