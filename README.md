# Turn-Green

## Data Base Mockup


This is the GitHub repository for our Tecnologico de Monterrey Boot Camp group's final project.

## Turn Green "The Impact of Renewable Energy on the CO2 Emissions"
One strategy for achieving the sustainable development goals is to close the gap between carbon emissions and economic development.

Group Members:
Ricardo López, Irving Hernández, Armando, Daniela Rodríguez

While members are assigned specific roles, we all work together on each part of the project

## Selected Topic - Renewable Energy Impact on the World

# Overview: 
To reduce CO2 emissions and local air pollution, the world must rapidly transition to low-carbon energy sources such as nuclear and renewable technology.
Renewable energy will be critical in decarbonizing our energy systems in the future decades.

# Objective: 
The Turn Green Tool predicts whether the CO2 emmissions will rise or fall in at least the principle countries of the world by examining renewable usage and co2 gas emissions patterns data.

When looking for sustainable pattern policies, for example, someone will be able to compare the renewable energy implementation, Co2 gases emissions and climate change impact of the principle countries of the world. This could help kids comprehend the similarities and differences between countries sustainable energy policies and help the world makequickly decisiones
