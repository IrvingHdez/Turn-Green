## Data description
The database is composed of two files; co-emissions-per-capita.csv and renewable-share-energy.csv. These two share three fields - entity, code and year - with which we can create a SQL table join.

## Data Storage
The data files will be stored in an AWS RDS Database and linked to pgAdmin to create the database tables and relationships between the data.
